Self-taught software engineer 🛠 from Italy, economist by training, now navigating Silicon Valley’s tech maze. I live to build; be it groundbreaking code or IKEA furniture (debatable which is trickier).

Currently based in SF, busy building LLM projects and writing tech-related articles in my downtime. I let curiosity take me places and use backpropagation to improve my life.
